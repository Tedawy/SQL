    SELECT * 
    FROM products

    ```

### 10.	Using LIMIT, OFFSET, and Aggregation:

- **Question:** Write a query to retrieve the top 5 products by total sales (assume there’s a sales table with product_id and quantity columns), but skip the top 2 results and show the next 5 products.

- **Answer:**
    ```sql
    SELECT * 
    FROM products 
    WHERE product_id IN (
        SELECT product_id
        FROM sales
        GROUP BY product_id
        HAVING SUM(quantity) > 0
        ORDER BY SUM(quantity) DESC
        LIMIT 5 OFFSET 2
    );
    ```
